# FLUX-LoRA Fine-Tuning Toolkit  
   
## Overview  
   
The FLUX-LoRA Fine-Tuning Toolkit is a production-grade Python package designed for efficiently fine-tuning the FLUX.1-schnell vision model using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation). This toolkit aims to enable users to create customized models that effectively capture brand identities and generate appealing content.  
   
## Objectives  
   
1. **Fine-Tuning Implementation**: Develop robust Python code to fine-tune the FLUX.1-schnell model using a dataset of images (1200x1200 pixels) and their associated captions.  
   
2. **LoRa Fine-Tuning**: Utilize LoRa fine-tuning techniques to enhance the training process, ensuring efficient use of resources while maintaining high performance.  
   
3. **Optimization of the Fine-Tuning Process**:   
   - Minimize the cost of the fine-tuning process while maximizing performance.  
   - Research and implement various performance metrics, including CLIPScore, FID, and AestheticScore, to evaluate the model's effectiveness in capturing brand characteristics.  
   
4. **Test Case Execution**:   
   - Run test cases on a selection of art images to analyze the correlation between "style of art" and "individual company."  
   - Create compelling visualizations to present the metrics gathered during the evaluation phase.  
   
5. **Cloud Provider Evaluation**: Conduct experiments on three different hardware providers (AWS, Replit, and Private Cloud) to determine the optimal choice based on cost and performance considerations.  
   
## Quick Start  
   
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone <this-repo>  
   ```  
   
2. Install the package:  
   ```bash  
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121 
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install xformers
   ```  
   
3. Configure your fine-tuning parameters:  
   ```bash  
   cp configs/ft_config.yaml my_run.yaml  
   # Edit my_run.yaml for necessary configurations  
   ```  
   
4. Start fine-tuning:  
   ```bash  
   fluxft finetune --cfg-path my_run.yaml  
   ```  
   
5. Evaluate your fine-tuned model:  
   ```bash  
   fluxft evaluate --cfg-path my_run.yaml --lora-path outputs/ckpt-final --prompts-file prompts.txt  
   ```

## Installation  
   
Ensure you have a CUDA-enabled GPU (11GB VRAM or more recommended) and then set up your environment:  
   
```bash  
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  
pip install --upgrade pip  
pip install -e .  
huggingface-cli login  # Required for accessing gated FLUX model  
```
